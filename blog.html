        <h1 class="text-3xl">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1><br>
        <p>var: Has function scope. It is hoisted to the top of its function, meaning it can be used before it's declared. If declared outside any function, it becomes a global variable.<br>

            let: Has block scope, meaning it is limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) where it's declared. It is not hoisted in a way that allows it to be used before the block.<br>
            
            const: Also has block scope, similar to let, but it additionally cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, the values they hold (if objects or arrays) can still be modified.<br>
            
            Understanding these scoping rules helps prevent unintended variable reassignments and contributes to more predictable code behavior.<br></p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p>
            null is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value, while undefined typically indicates an<br>uninitialized or missing value in JavaScript.<br></p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A<br> RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web<br> services that adhere to the principles of REST.<br>

            In a REST API:<br>
            
            1. Resources: Everything is treated as a resource, and each resource is uniquely identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Resources can represent data entities or services.<br><br>
            
            2. Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill <br>that request. The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests.<br><br>
            
            3. Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML. Clients interact with these <br>representations to manipulate the state of resources.<br><br>
            
            4. Uniform Interface: The API should have a uniform and consistent interface, including standard conventions for naming <br>resources, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and returning standardized responses.<br>
            
            5. Stateless Communication: The communication between the client and server is stateless, meaning each request from a client <br>to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill that request.<br><br>
            
            RESTful APIs are widely used in web development and are the standard for building scalable and maintainable web services.<br> They rely on the HTTP protocol for communication, making them simple and widely adopted.</p>
